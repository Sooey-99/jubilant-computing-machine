# Portfolio

## Description

My personal portfolio page. 

A portfolio of work to showcase my skills and talents to others. My portfolio highlights my strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. Students who have portfolios with deployed web applications are typically very successful in their career search and so this is the reasoning behind showcasing my own portfolio. 

I aim to set myself up for future success by applying the core skills learned recently: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables, creating something that I will use during your job search.


## Acceptance Criteria

I aim to reach the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport


## Usage 

Open the web application in your web browser and review information as you would with a standard web-page.


## Credits

I'd  like to credit Edx for their support and guidance in the process of creating this portfolio and advising what information would be critical to include.
